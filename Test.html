		<p> Ok for real, I sure that many of us wants to Know the meaning of life?</p>
		<p>Life is the aspect of existence that processes, acts, reacts, evaluates,
		and evolves through growth (reproduction and metabolism). The crucial difference between
		life and non-life (or non-living things) is that life uses energy for physical and conscious
		development. Life is anything that grows and eventually dies, i.e., ceases to proliferate and be
		cognizant. Can we say that viruses, for example, are cognizant? Yes, insofar as they react to stimuli
		; but they are alive essentially because they reproduce and grow. Computers are non-living because even
		though they can cognize, they do not develop biologically (grow), and cannot produce offspring. It is not
		cognition that determines life, then: it is rather proliferation and maturation towards a state of death;
		and death occurs only to living substances.</p>

			be passive in your life, take control of it</p>
